# ContractDifficultyMangler

In vanilla BATTLETECH contracts are rigidly sorted into 3 buckets. D2 Easy contracts, D5 medium contracts and D8 Hard contracts. Contracts change from one set to the next at D4 from Easy to Mediums and D7 for Hards.

This mod allows configuring what difficulties to look for in contract defs (2/5/8 by default) and when the changes from lower to higher one happen (4/7). With default configuration nothing changes compared to vanilla. Made mostly for use with expanded difficulty scale so the early contracts can be spread out a bit further than being all crammed up in the beginning. 

All 5 values this mod works with are configurable in the `mod.json`.
